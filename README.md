ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, Iâ€™m @EnvelopedCode

I'm a Junior Colombian Dev from MedellÃ­n City. Right now I'm interested in Web Developement, 
so I've been taking a lot of knowledge ranging from Python, Javascript, React, up to 
NodeJS and MongoDB (I'm also acquainted with SQL, so I'm planning on learning MySQL next time (learned thru SQLite)) 
Right now I'm trying to build my own Website so I'll be probably making commits around my repositories when the time comes. 
Also, If you like mentoring motivated Juniors or you're kind enough to get me into a small project feel free to DM 
me on Discord: Schweinefleisch#6747

Thanks for wasting your time reading this :p
